I've found out this is address is a Binance Ethereum pool. || I hope you got this taken care of. If not please let me know. Hope all is well know though || This is an exchange address. All of the funds at this address belong to the sum total of all of the customers of the exchange itself and some to the exchange. If you got scammed and somehow followed it to this address  that means the scammer probably has an account at this exchange. This seems to be a binance address. So  you need to find the actual wallet address of the scammer which will not be this address. Then  perhaps  binance themselves could help identify the scammer. The sad truth is that most of the time there is absolutely nothing that can be done. Cryptocurrency is  for the most part  completely untraceable. Most of you commenting about getting scammed or phished need to be leary and distrustful OF ANY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMING TO BE ABLE TO HELP. Oftentimes they will offer to be able to help if you email them or telegram them - truth is  they are scamming pieces of crap too just looking to try to steal anything you might have left. Many of them have cursed me and told me to drop dead for warning people against their scamming ways  but I don't give a shit - I will continue to point out any scamming piece of crap that I encounter. NOTE THAT MANY OF THEM WILL CREATE FAKE EMAIL ADDRESSES THAT HAVE ETHERSCAN  ETHEREUM OR OTHER OFFICIAL SOUNDING NAMES AS PART OF THE EMAIL ADDRESS. Don't fall for that shit either. It's rubbish. Protect yourself and exercise caution - never click on suspicious links within emails (unless you want to infect your computer with malware)  never fill in unsolicited forms  google or otherwise and NEVER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE ANYONE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS - these forums are loaded with predators preying on newbies which are easily identified by \"what can be done about it\" types of questions... truth is when funds are stolen - they are gone... create a new wallet and start over because the old wallet is compromised. || I was scammed out of $54000.00 a few weeks ago.

What had happened was that you mistakenly sent your Ether to a smart contract address owned by EtherDelta: 0x8d12a197cb00d4747a1fe03395095ce2a5cc6819  (Etherdelta make it WAY too easy to do this).  If you are lucky  like me  the gas will be really low on your Ether transactions.   This meant it was pending for a long time.   It allowed me time to resend a transaction worth 0 ETH but much higher gas  using the same nonce number as the previous transaction.   I used My ether wallet and \"offline transaction\" to do this.  Full steps can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/72tctz/guide_how_to_cancel_a_pending_transaction/ || I just wanted to say thanks so much for posting this. It took a few attempts  but i managed to override my accidental transaction to etherdelta_2. Cost me just $2. Very happy with that!

Is belong To a thief but i know that your platform respect thiefs and Mada fuc***r because your platform is created by a thief too. That is why you Will receive only thiefs and hackers in your platform. Nothing else. I personally never put my money in such a irresponsible platform like yours. Who doesn't need kyc and help thiefs to steal people and transform their steal money into ethereum to withdraw it without any verification. I will do my best to close your platform by interpol that's looking for those thiefs. I know when they live already. But your platform will be closed asap too. Because all stolen money go to your platform.

I am interested in protecting myself against hacks also so any information on how the hack happened would be appreciated. There is of course the criminals who run exchanges. I have no reason at this point in time to believe that Mercatox are are bad  they have so far been ok in all dealing I have had with them  unlike what I have experienced from the Yobit exchange  who I believe control the majority of their troll box blogs manipulating users responses to the scams they perform on their own users of what should be a service. I personally lost a lot of value on Yobit when their exchange was suffering technical dramas  raised tickets to yobit support did not even get a response  This is my first public broadcast about the deceptive scam techniques Yobit has used on mine and others accounts  and I am pleased that such blockchain blogs exist as this may be a way for all of us in the community to bring down the decepter cons  in fact its an optimal prime way for this to happen and so I thank you for bringing this to my attention  with your msg here || Thanks Mercatox for serving the Blockchain World and Wixlar WIX Community.
