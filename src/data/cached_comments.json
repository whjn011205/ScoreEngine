After arguing with him about 1 month he sent me 1 ETH back out of 7. Please help!! Thanks in Adavnced. My Eth address is 0x7469c8469bfe4d66a805eafd0a3ea15647aae4e3 || This is officially ABSOLUTELY INSANE!! I REALLY hope you got your ETH back ESPECIALLY KNOWING who took it. Everyone is led to believe that there is no way or anything you can do about these situations once they are confirmed on the chain. Well that's definitely  NOT TRUE!! SO AGAIN I REALLY hope you got this taken care of and if not let me try and handle it.  Makes me SICK to see sooo many people fall victim to these scammers who USUALLY  ARE ALREADY  multi millionaires and take anything from 1$- to hundreds I'd thousands from the average person that CANT afford to lose that.. ughh this makes my skin crawl. I really really hope this is taken care of now if not please  let me know. ||  || Dont fall for scam guys. Never send here Eths. You will just regret. || I already received 10 ETH ! Thanks a lot <3 || +5 ETH . WOooooW amazing || Hello ! Can somebody send me 0.05 eth please? For my school loan. I'm very pleased if you send Here is my eth address : 0x7d9e8aded4f8a077652f74343267fb479ef58a1f || please :( || lol no || Anyone ever actually look at the wallet? My guess that it is a supply wallet for Binance  and to think that a guy that \"scammed you\" was honest enough to take your monies and give you his correct address at the same time is well.... not smart  the guy probably paid you 1 ETH after a month just to get you quiet! Wallet Holder  if I am correct send anything to   0xB79E0E2111162b268361d0219E8f90cA774a714C so I can confirm this and accusers can view.",
